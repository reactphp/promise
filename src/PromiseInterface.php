     * Transforms a promise's value by applying a function to the promise's fulfillment
     * or rejection value. Returns a new promise for the transformed result.

     * (all parameters are optional):
     *
     *  * `$onFulfilled` will be invoked once the promise is fulfilled and passed
     *     the result as the first argument.

     *     reason as the first argument.
     *
     * It returns a new promise that will fulfill with the return value of either
     * `$onFulfilled` or `$onRejected`, whichever is called, or will reject with
     * the thrown exception if either throws.
     *
     * A promise makes the following guarantees about handlers registered in
     * the same call to `then()`:
     *
     *  1. Only one of `$onFulfilled` or `$onRejected` will be called,
     *      never both.
     *  2. `$onFulfilled` and `$onRejected` will never be called more
     *      than once.

     *
     * * If `$promise` fulfills, and `$onFulfilledOrRejected` returns successfully,
     *    `$newPromise` will fulfill with the same value as `$promise`.
     * * If `$promise` fulfills, and `$onFulfilledOrRejected` throws or returns a
     *    rejected promise, `$newPromise` will reject with the thrown exception or
     *    rejected promise's reason.
     * * If `$promise` rejects, and `$onFulfilledOrRejected` returns successfully,
     *    `$newPromise` will reject with the same reason as `$promise`.

     * `finally()` behaves similarly to the synchronous finally statement. When combined
     * with `catch()`, `finally()` allows you to write code that is similar to the familiar
     * synchronous catch/finally pair.

     *     return handleError($e);
     * } finally {
     *     cleanup();
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * Similar asynchronous code (with `doSomething()` that returns a promise) can be
     * written:
     *
     * ```php
     * return doSomething()
     *     ->catch('handleError')
     *     ->finally('cleanup');
