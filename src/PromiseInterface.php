     * (all parameters are optional):
     *
     *  * `$onFulfilled` will be invoked once the promise is fulfilled and passed

     * `$onFulfilled` or `$onRejected`, whichever is called, or will reject with
     * the thrown exception if either throws.
     *
     * A promise makes the following guarantees about handlers registered in
     * the same call to `then()`:
     *
     *  1. Only one of `$onFulfilled` or `$onRejected` will be called,
     *      never both.
     *  2. `$onFulfilled` and `$onRejected` will never be called more
     *      than once.

     *
     * * If `$promise` fulfills, and `$onFulfilledOrRejected` returns successfully,

     * `always()` behaves similarly to the synchronous finally statement. When combined

     * }

     * Similar asynchronous code (with `doSomething()` that returns a promise) can be
     * written:
     *
     * ```php
     * return doSomething()
     *     ->otherwise('handleError')
     *     ->always('cleanup');
